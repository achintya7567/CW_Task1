I am a coding enthusiast and started basic coding and web development in school.
I like developing things as well as problem solving. Besides, I love cricket (watching and analysis).


I want to contribute to open source as it provides me a big opportunity to showcase my talent and also help others develop their projects and along the way I can learn more about different technologies.
